# Instructions for analyzing CircTA-seq data

What is in the package file
====
batch_all.sh: shell script, need editing
analysis_circtaseq.py: python script for analyze yeast pre-rRNA. 
  Editing is not needed unless you want to change default setting or analyze other RNAs. 
genome/: reference sequence (35Sext) and database
X19/: sample sequencing data X19_R1.fq.gz, X19_R2_fq.gz (20k). Other processing output files
K31/ to K39/: only output files for testing gnuplot drawing
fig/: 2 script for gnuplot drawing and output figure.
Location of files and directions are important. 

Installation
====
#Python modules could be installed in "conda install"
python 3
biopython
numpy

#Other programs could be installed for example via "sudo apt install cutadapt" in Ubuntu
cutadapt
seqtk
ncbi-blast+

Usage
====
1. Sequencing files should be named x_R1.fq.gz, x_R2_fq.gz and be put in directory "x"
2. edit directory and steps in batch_all.sh
3. run the script 

sh batch_all.sh

Draw figure in gnuplot
====
The processing output files in individual directory from the above analysis 
are used for drawing figure in gnuplot.
1. open gnuplot 5.2 patchlevel 7 
2. change to /fig directory
3. edit fig_landscape_all.plt and fig_landscape_all.plt
4. load 'fig_landscape_all.plt'
5. load 'fig_newpolya_all.plt'
