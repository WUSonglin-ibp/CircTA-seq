The pipeline is specifically designed to analyze pre-rRNAs of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
If you need to analyze other RNAs, you properly need to modify the codes bracketed by "Yeast pre-rRNA specific setting"


What is in the package 
====
Location of files and directions are important. 
batch_all.sh: shell script for all processing, need editing
analysis_circtaseq.py: script for processing blastn alignment files of CircTA-seq data
  Editing is not needed unless you want to change default setting or analyze other RNAs. 
genome/: reference sequence (35Sext) and database for alignment
X19/: sample sequencing data (X19_R1.fq.gz, X19_R2_fq.gz) and processing output files
K31/ to K39/: Processing output files for testing gnuplot drawing
fig/: gnuplot scripts for drawing figure.

Installation
====
#Python modules could be installed in "conda install"
python 3
biopython
numpy

#Other programs could be installed for example via "sudo apt install cutadapt" in Ubuntu
cutadapt
seqtk
ncbi-blast+

Usage
====
1. Sequencing files should be named x_R1.fq.gz and x_R2_fq.gz and be put in directory "x"
2. edit directory list and steps in batch_all.sh
3. run the script 
sh batch_all.sh

Draw figure in gnuplot
====
Processing output files in individual directory are used to draw figure in gnuplot.
1. open gnuplot, change to /fig directory
2. edit fig_landscape_all.plt and fig_landscape_all.plt
3. load 'fig_landscape_all.plt' in gnuplot
4. load 'fig_newpolya_all.plt' in gnuplot
